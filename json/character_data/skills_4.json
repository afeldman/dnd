This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast- talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone\u2019s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie."]}
