When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class\u2019s spell list (the three needn\u2019t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don\u2019t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don\u2019t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.", "If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.", "Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-\u00adedged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast."]}
