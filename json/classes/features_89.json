Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.", "If your deity intervenes, you can\u2019t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.", "At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required."]}
