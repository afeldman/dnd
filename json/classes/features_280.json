Only another creature that knows thieves\u2019 cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.", "In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves\u2019 guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run."]}
