Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.", "A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can\u2019t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can\u2019t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there\u2019s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action."]}
