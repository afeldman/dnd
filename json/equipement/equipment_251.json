If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can\u2019t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land."]}
