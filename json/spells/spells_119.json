Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).", "When you cast this spell, you can designate a password.
