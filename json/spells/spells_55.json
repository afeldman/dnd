Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can\u2019t take actions, can\u2019t understand what other creatures say, can\u2019t read, and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast on you ends this effect.", "On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends.

If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer."]}
